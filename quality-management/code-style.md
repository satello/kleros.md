# Code

- Documentation and comments.
  - Use Doxygen comments.
  - Explain non-obvious portions of code.
  - Explain security choices.
  - Explain computational/gas complexity related choices.
- Good practice
  - Do not use magic numbers/values (define a constant like `MY_CONSTANT = 42`).
  - If you write the same code more than twice, you need to factorize it.
